# About Me

I am a PhD student in Health and Kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working under the guidance of Dr. Pedro C Hallal. Combining my academic foundation in kinesiology and sports management with my distinguished background as a National Master of Sports in Rhythmic Gymnastics, I investigate the intersection of physical activity and public health. My research focuses on innovative approaches to community health promotion, particularly through digital health technologies, with special attention to the evolution of physical activity research, healthy aging, and health economics. Through my recent work on bibliometric analysis of physical activity research in China and leveraging my strong quantitative analysis skills and multilingual capabilities, I strive to contribute meaningful insights to global public health challenges.

You can find my research work on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bRnW6HEAAAAJ'>Google Scholar</a> and connect with me on <a href='https://orcid.org/0009-0000-5589-410X'>ORCID</a>.
